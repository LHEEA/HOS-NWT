HOS-NWT is a Numerical Wave Tank based on the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method. It is dedicated to the generation and propagation of highly non-linear wave fields in wave basins with arbitrary constant depth. The proposed model reproduce all features of an ocean wave basin: directional wavemaker, reflective walls and absorbing beach. HOS-NWT takes into account free surface nonlinearities as well as wavemaker ones. It has been developed at Ecole Centrale de Nantes since 2003 and is used in several research projects.
